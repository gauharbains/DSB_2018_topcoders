Submission files will be in _predictions_ folder (submission_0.csv, submission_1.csv). 
Individual model predictions will be also in _predictions_ folder.

## How to run training
Before training please remove models from:
* albu/weights
* selim/nn_models
* victor/nn_models
* victor/lgbm_models

after it run:
```bash
./train_all.sh
./tune_all.sh
./predict_oof_trees.sh
```

We use two stage training because we want to tune models on stage1 data released 11.04.
Every script goes into every folder and runs scripts to train models.
