 Link to the original repository : https://github.com/selimsef/dsb2018_topcoders/
 
 The master branch consists of the code base downloaded from the drop box link provided in the above repository. I've made some chages to the code base so that removes some hard coded bits like : the original code base is hardocded to predict images in .png files, removed hard coded directories, added requiremetns.txt.
