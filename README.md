 Link to the original repository : https://github.com/selimsef/dsb2018_topcoders/
 
 The master branch consists of the code base downloaded from the drop box link provided in the above repository. I've made some chages to the code base to remove some hard coded bits like : the original code base is hardcoded to predict nuclei only in .png files, removed hard coded directories, added requirements.txt.
